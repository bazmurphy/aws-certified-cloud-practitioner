- [ ] You got a website where you got an upcoming sales event planned.

- [x] <u>You got a website that receives spike from traffic from time to time.</u>

### Question 4:

- [ ] Incoming load / traffic might not be distributed evenly across available instances, hence increasing cost.

- [x] <u>Incoming load / traffic might not be distributed evenly across available instances, hence overwhelming some instances.</u>

- [ ] Incoming load / traffic might not be distributed evenly across available instances, hence more instance must be added.

### Question 5:

Which statement about load balancer services (Application Load Balancer, ALB & Network Load Balancer, NLB) is NOT correct?

- [x] <u>ALB & NLB distribute traffic across all instances launched in a VPC.</u>

- [ ] ALB & NLB are both about distributing traffic and can sometimes be cused for the same kind of traffic.
