## Quiz

### Question 1:

**In the context of cloud computing & IT resources: What is "scaling" about?**

1. Scaling refers to switching to other services eg. to keep up with increasing traffic

2. Scaling refers to distributing load equally amongst available IT resources eg. to keep up with increasing traffic

3. <u>Scaling refers to adjusting the amount of available IT resources eg. to keep up with increasing traffic</u>

### Question 2:

**What's the purpose of the Auto Scaling service?**

1. <u>It automatically adds or removes EC2 instances, based on conditions/metrics defined by you.</u>

2. It automatically distributes incoming traffic across available instances to ensure that no instance gets overwhelmed.

3. It automatically adds or removes EC2 instance, based on best-practice metrics defined by AWS.

### Question 3:

**In which scenario would Auto Scaling be especially helpful?**

1. You got a website where you have a very even traffic pattern without spikes.

2. You got a website where you got an upcoming sales event planned.

3. <u>You got a website that receives spike from traffic from time to time.</u>

Question 4:

Which problem is directly solved by load balancer services?

1. Incoming load / traffic might not be distributed evenly across available instances, hence increasing cost.

2. <u>Incoming load / traffic might not be distributed evenly across available instances, hence overwhelming some instances.</u>

3. Incoming load / traffic might not be distributed evenly across available instances, hence more instance must be added.

### Question 5:

Which statement about load balancer services (Application Load Balancer, ALB & Network Load Balancer, NLB) is NOT correct?

1. <u>ALB & NLB distribute traffic across all instances launched in a VPC.</u>

2. ALB & NLB are both about distributing traffic and can sometimes be cused for the same kind of traffic.

3. ALB & NLB distribute traffic across all instances in defined target groups.

### Question 6:

1.  <u>ALB & NLB can be used for all kinds of traffic (including but not limited to HTTPS) but ALB is preferable for HTTP(S) traffic.</u>

2.  NLB comes with a static IP address, ALB does not.

3.  ALB offers more configuration options (more conditions for forwarding traffic to specific instances / target groups).
